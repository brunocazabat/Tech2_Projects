All newspapers in Britain, daily or Sunday can be divided into :

---> They also carry financial reports, travel news and books/films reviews
- The popular press of the "POPULARS" also known as TABLOIDS
-> Are smaller in size being halfsheet in format
--> Offering news  for the people less interested in daily detailled news reports
---> Large headlines/carry a lot of pictures/personnal aspects of news/report of juicy bits of events (including the rayal family)
----> The language of a tabloid is much more COLLOQUIAL, if not specificc than that of quality newspapers
A tradition of the most TITILATING kind for the past 45 years (introduced by the sun in 1970), UK tabloid THE Sunday
> Has featured models on page 3 while it seems outrageous of showing exposed boobs (models are always on page 3)
-> This feature is over but we can still find Topless models on the website (PAGE 3 WEBSITE since June 1999)
-->




SECOND AFTERNOON __ 2

Following the lead of the daily mirror : 
- The sun had been featuring pictures of clothed women in suggestive poses on its pages since it had
- First become a tabloid under the new ownership of Rupert Murdoch in 1969
- The terms " Page 3 " are registered Trademarks of News UK, parent COmpany of the Sun
- Although the feature has been initiated in Britain's other red tops.

GIRLS WERE COMPARED WITH BANGERS AND MASH ( SAUSAGE AND MASH, A TRADITIONAL BRITISH DISH )

FEMINIST HAS BEEN FIGHTING FOR THE "NO MORE PAGE 3" AND IT'S A SUCCESS FOR THEM
THIS PAGE 3 WAS DEMEANING, SEXIST AND EXPLOITIVE.
"NO PAGE 3, MORE SEXUAL EGALITY".

"IT'S ONLY A PARTIAL VICTORY FOR EGALITY"

A PART OF THIS "COVERED DOWN" IS DUE TO ADVERTISERS "WHO WANTED TO STOP PAID FOR NAKED GIRLS"

INOCUOUS = INNOFENSIF

Showing your bobs is a freedom for some girls.



THIRD AFTERNOON __ 3

Playboy in a few words
- a cultural phenomenon thats was a rite of passage for a generation of american mens.
- an illicit thrill in adolescent bedrooms or garden sheds
- helps spark America's sexual revolution
- from its beginning editor-in-chief HUGH HEFNER founded the magazine on full nudity

Playboy's logo has been designed in 10mins

During the heyday, readers could read writings and journalism
But also stories about Jack Kerouac, Joseph Heller, Haruki Murakami and Margaret Atwood.
And interviews about Frank Sinatra, Malcom X and Jimmy Carter.

The interview of Jimmy Carter on the playboy magazine has made him President (in heart adultery)

FOURTH AFTERNOON __ 4

The picture of the swedish model Lena Soderberg, the photographer Dwight Hooker -> THE FIRST LADY OF THE INTERNET
His picture was selected by an engineer to develop a new technology of picture modification (Digital Imaging)

The second picture with black font, when it came out, about 7millions of peoples bought it (november 1972 aka highest selling issue in playboy history)

Nudity was always a big selling point of the magazine, it attracted a lot of girls too, like NAOMI CAMPELL aka BO DEREK

PLAYBOY was read by almost a Quarter of all American Male college student in the 1970s, it explained sex to a generation of american men.

THE NED OF TOTALLY NUDE women
Because the internet has made them outdated.
it's a break with a 62 years format that has had a significant impact on American Culture.
The idea of Playboy dispensing with Nudity would once have been unthinkable.

BUT IN MARCH 2016, it happened -> "You're now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free" and so it's just passe at this juncture"
IN MARCH 2017 "pictures of nudity removed was a mistakes, They are coming back in a new way, they were too 'too old fashion' "
